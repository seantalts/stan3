// In this file, we'd like to keep track of:
// 1. Function signatures available from the Stan Math library,
// 2. Functions and other globally available functionality we'd like to add in Rust,
// 3. Functions we'd like to add with Stan code and make generally available.

// To keep track of what the Math library has available, we'll likely
// need to import the Stan repo function signatures here as a
// submodule or some other reference to Stan develop.
// We'll probably need both the functions.txt output from the manual(?)
// as well as the function_signatures.h programmatic definitions.
